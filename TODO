1. Port clutter-reflect to current clutter API

2. Port the required code to open a window for kaa.display and add it
   to x11.py. This removed one dependency and we only need a small
   part of kaa.display.

3. Fix DVD playback. Maybe use vlc for that.

X. All FIXME, TODO and @todo messages in the code should be fixed. And add
   more doc (always a good idea)
